## Scenario A — Price −10%

- **New Weekly Revenue:** 150.71 vs Baseline 109.84  
- **Revenue Delta:** +40.87 (+37.2%)  
- Elastic items (e.g., Chicken Sandwich, Cheeseburger) generate **more revenue** when price is reduced, because the increase in quantity outweighs the lower price.

## Scenario B — Price +10%

- **New Weekly Revenue:** 57.44 vs Baseline 109.84  
- **Revenue Delta:** −52.40 (−47.7%)  
- Elastic items lose revenue when prices are raised. The drop in quantity is greater than the gain from higher prices.

### Key takeaway
The dashboard connects **elasticity estimates from Snowflake** with **what-if analysis in Sigma**. It makes clear which products are sensitive to price changes and shows the revenue impact of both cuts and increases at a glance.
