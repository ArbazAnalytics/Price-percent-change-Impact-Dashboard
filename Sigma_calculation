# ðŸ“Š Sigma What-If Scenario Dashboard

This folder documents the **Sigma dashboard** built on top of the SQL elasticity analysis.

---

## 1. Starting Point
From SQL we had:
- **Elasticity (slope):** demand sensitivity to price changes.
- **RÂ² (fit quality):** reliability of the elasticity estimate.
- **Filtered results:** only items with `rÂ² > 0.10` and `elasticity < 0` (valid demand curves).

---

## 2. Why More Calculations Were Needed
Elasticity alone tells us the **% demand change when price changes**, but to evaluate *business impact* we also needed:

- **Baseline Price & Quantity** â†’ starting reference point.  
- **New Price & New Quantity** â†’ updated values after price change.  
- **Revenue Delta** â†’ difference between baseline and new revenue.  

These calculations connect the *statistical model* to *real revenue outcomes*.

## 3. Core Formulas in Sigma

```sql
-- % Demand change based on elasticity and slider input
Demand Change % = [Elasticity] * [Price Change %]

-- New quantity sold
New Quantity = [avg_weekly_qty] * (1 + [Demand Change %])

-- New price
New Price = [baseline_price] * (1 + [Price Change %])

-- Simulated revenue (new average weekly revenue)
New Revenue = [New_Qty] * [New_Price]

-- Gain/loss vs baseline
Revenue Delta = [New_Revenue] - [avg_weekly_revenue]
